# Part 1: Learning

Basically i followed the tutourial at the [Docker Docs](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) and tried to learn as much as i can from it. 

I did skip running mutliple machines tho, since i was too lazy to actually install Virtualbox. 

It is done up to part 5, since part 6 is actual deployment. Also the port for the main server is 3000 instead of port 80 since that is just stupid
